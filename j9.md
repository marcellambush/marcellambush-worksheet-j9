## J9 Worksheet  

**Question 1:** A design pattern is a template that is used towards software engineering problems. These templates are used over and over throughout the field of software development. A java library
is a collection of written code for functionality and to make certain problems easier to handle.  
**Question 2:** 
```Java
public class DBSingleton{
    // This is a private member variable so that the file
    // can only be accessed through the getInstance() method.
    private static LargeFile file;
    private static Connect connection;

    // Private constructor forces the class to be instantiated 
    // via the getInstance method.
    private DBSingleton() {
        // private constructor
        // set up the object here
        connection = new Donnection("username", "1234","120.5.4.4")
      
        try{
            FileInputStream fstream = new FileInputStream("my_large_file.txt");
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(fstream));

            String strLine;
            while ((strLine = br.readLine()) != null)   {
                fileContents.append(strLine);
            }
            fstream.close();     
        } catch (IOException e){
            System.out.println("Sorry could not open your file.");
        }

    }

    // Method to get an instance of this class.
    public static DBSingleton getInstance() {
        // If this singleton instance is null, 
        // then construct a new instance.
        // Otherwise return the existing instance.
        if (connection == null) {
            connection = new DBSingleton;
        }

        return file;
    }
}
```
**Question 3:**
```Java
//constructor for animal
Animal (int weight, String name)
  weight = weight
  name = name

//constructor for bird
Bird (int weight, String name)
  weight = weight
  name = name

Mammal (int weight, String name)
  weight = weight
  name = name

//class Factory
public static type getAnimal(int weight, String name){
  switch(type)
    case "Mammal"
      return new Mammal (weight, name);
    case "Bird"
      return new Bird (weight, name)
}
```  
**Question 4:** 
```Java
public class MammalAdapter extends Fish{
  private MammalAdapter mammal;
  //set up in constructor

  public static public void feed(String food, int weight){
    return mammal.feed( food,  weight,  medication) {
  }
  public void clean(String cleaningProduct) {
    return mammal.clean()
  }
}
```
**Question 5:** The bridge pattern is used to divide an implementation from an abstration - this design pattern would be used for flexibility purposes
in a programmers software.
